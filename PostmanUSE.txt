Yes, the actions outlined in my previous response are correct for testing the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
 operations of your Flask API using Postman. They provide a step-by-step guide for simulating various HTTP 
requests to interact with your Flask application.

By following those steps, you can use Postman to:

Create new details (POST request).
Retrieve details (GET request).
Update existing details (POST request to the update endpoint).
Delete details (GET request to the delete endpoint).
These actions cover the fundamental functionality of your Flask application. 
Adjust the details in Postman, such as the URLs and request data, based on the specific 
structure and requirements of your Flask API.





When you use SQLite, the entire database is contained within a single file, which makes it easy to manage. 
Your program can directly interact with this file to read, write, and modify data. It's like having a 
notebook where you can quickly jot down or look up information whenever you need it.

On the other hand, when you use databases like MySQL, they typically run as separate server processes 
that are not directly embedded within your program. This means your program needs to communicate with the
 MySQL server over a network connection, which adds an extra layer of complexity. It's like having a 
separate office building where your files are stored,
 and you need to send requests to access or modify the files through an intermediary.
